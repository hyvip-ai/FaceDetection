A simple face-detection app using face-api and html,css,javascript using this after turing on our camera we have to wait for 20-30 seconds to load the modules and after
that we should be able to see a face detector on our video I used canvas for this here I have done both the wireframe and dot map on face and it also predict
users age, gender and also emotions.
